# Retail-Sales-Prediction
In this project, we leverage machine learning algorithms to predict retail sales. Accurate sales forecasting can help businesses optimize their inventory management, plan marketing campaigns, and make informed business decisions. The project utilizes a dataset containing historical sales data along with various features such as product information, store information, and promotional events. By training a machine learning model on this data, we aim to create a predictive model that can forecast future sales accurately.

The key features of this project include:
* Data preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the dataset for training.
* Feature engineering: Creating relevant features from the available data.
* Model training: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to train a predictive model.
* Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model.
* Sales prediction: Using the trained model to make sales forecasts.

The dataset used in this project consists of historical sales data and associated features. It includes information such as store ID, product ID, date, sales, promotions, and other relevant attributes. Due to confidentiality reasons, the exact dataset used in this project cannot be provided. However, you can use your own retail sales dataset or find publicly available datasets for retail sales forecasting.
